# Introduction
I went to a chamber music performance earlier today to support my friends, a violinist, a cellist, a pianist, and a violist. They were performing Piano Quartet No. 1 in G Minor, Op.25 by Brahms, and when the piece started, I sat up straight and stared at the quartet intensely. I wanted to feel the piece as they felt it; I yearned to become lost in the music as avid readers do in a terrific novel. Yet not even before the first movement was done, my mind couldn't help but begin to wander. The sounds of the four distinct instruments gradually blended together into white noise as I became distracted with periphery details, such as the performance attire of the quartet or the specific color of flowers of some well-intending audience members.

Some would say that I just became bored, but I was actually very frustrated with myself. Why couldn't I appreciate classical music? The fact that I played bassoon in my high school band and orchestra seemed to add insult to injury. For if I, having performed in a classical music setting, couldn't appreciate listening to classical music, then how could a complete foreigner to the art, such as my parents, enjoy a chamber music performance? I was troubled because I thought that I *ought* to appreciate performances of classical music, especially ones that are of the highest-quality like today's performance was. I want, in all senses of the word, to appreciate performances of classical music. But perhaps there's a logical reason for why I can't. 

# Familiarity and Appreciation
The first thing that I should get on the table is that it's not that I can't appreciate *any* classical music. For instance, I love listening to performances of pieces that I've performed before, my favorite being Beethoven's *Seventh Symphony, Movement Two*, which I performed in the junior year of high school. I also enjoy movie soundtracks, despite the fact that I've only performed one (John Williams' *Across the Stars*). Let's use the first example as a starting place. At first, it seems intuitive that I would enjoy a piece that I've performed before, but we should think about why this is actually the case. Indeed, familiarity doesn't always correlate with appreciation. In fact, the opposite is often the case. People who are unfamiliar with a certain cuisine, for instance, find that sampling from it provides them with much enjoyment primarily because they've never tasted food from it before. More trivially, listening to a song over an over leads to its listening experience providing diminishing marginal returns. Though this one is a tenuous analogy, it at least seems to suggest that the claim that familiarity always correlates with appreciation is non-trivial and needs to be unpacked.

Familiarity with a musical piece seems to suggest something deeper than just knowing what sounds will be played. When I was rehearsing the second movement of Beethoven's *Seventh*, our conductor constantly reminded us of the themes at play. He emphasized that the melody was to be distinctly *haunting*, and he would become livid when we failed to do it justice. And on a simpler level, rehearsing the piece and becoming familiar with it taught me its intricacies and nuances. I learned that the first section of the Symphony was a soli, featuring only the violas. Details like these made me *understand* the piece, where by understand I mean that I could hear what Beethoven was trying to accomplish. When the piece becomes quiet, when it becomes loud and when it slows down, I know *why* it's doing so, not that it just is. In other words, being familiar with a piece meant that I understood what it was trying to do, whether the composer was trying to convey some artistic message about modern society or simply trying to evoke an emotion through the different blends of instruments. 

A lack of familiarity in this sense also precludes me from enjoying other instances of fine art. For instance, in my English class, we read William Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*, a book that's notoriously difficult to read due to the many stylistic shenanigans Faulkner pulls. Reading the first section was like being tossed into the middle of a dark maze with nowhere to go except forward until inevitably running into a sentence whose meaning was totally lost on me. I quickly gave up; I simply couldn't appreciate Faulkner's writing because I quite literally didn't know what he was doing. At least, until my professor explained the reasoning behind Faulkner's literary decisions, and why at page so-and-so he says x-y-z. The illumination my professor provided was incredibly helpful, for afterwards, I was able to grasp the general motifs that Faulkner conveys, the most important being the sound and the fury of the Compson family's demise. 

# The Empathy Hypothesis
Call this the *Artistic Empathy Hypothesis*: one appreciates some performance of art because he/she understands what's trying to be accomplished in the piece. This hypothesis seems to explain why I appreciate movie soundtracks. Soundtracks are intended to serve as the background for a visual scene, and in doing so, they augment the scene by adding some form of emotional stimuli. Thus, for each of these pieces, there is a clear emotion or message that is trying to be conveyed; not only this, but it must be conveyed in simple terms, because the movie go-ers attention is primarily on the visual scene, not the music. This would also explain the rare examples of classical pieces that I enjoy, despite them not being soundtracks or me ever performing them. One example of this is Gustav Holst's *Jupiter: the Bringer of Joy*. Just reading the title and listening to its upbeat and dynamic rhythms gives me all the information I need: the piece is meant to evoke a sense of joy and liveliness.

We can extend this hypothesis to all performances, giving us the *Empathy Hypothesis*: one appreciates some performance because he/she understands what's trying to be accomplished in the performance. This would explain why sporting games command so much attention from audience members, even though the vast majority of fans haven't played the sport. For instance, as a football fan, I don't need to know all the nuances of the game, such as what pre-snap formations mean what play will be run or the specific routes receivers run to get open. I know that the goal of the game is to get the ball in the endzone, and that's enough to appreciate the game. Surprisingly, a similar appreciation is derived from fans of professional chess, a game that's full of nuance and complexity. The vast majority of watchers, being amateurs, surely aren't able to comprehend the depth of calculation and complexity that the pros think through at every single move. But they can still appreciate an intense game because they know what's trying to be accomplished: checkmate.

# Making Changes
At the beginning of this post, I said that I want to appreciate performances of classical music. The Musical Empathy Hypothesis tells me why I struggle to, and it also tells me that in order to appreciate a performance of classical music, I must familiarize myself with it to the point that I understand what the piece is trying to accomplish.

My roommate is a violist in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra; suppose he's performing this weekend and asks me to come support him. As his friend and roommate, I will go and support him, but while I'm there, I obviously want to enjoy the performance, something that I perenially struggle to do when the HRO performs. Here are some things I can do to make sure things are different this time: 
- Research the piece beforehand, with a particular emphasis on the motivation of the composer. What was he/she trying to do with this piece? Was it commissioned for some occasion, and if so, what was the occasion? It seems unnecessary, but I could also try to understand the details and nuances of the piece by listening to a recording. Having basic orchestral knowledge, I should be able to recognize different blends of strings and winds. Getting the general structure of the piece will help me understand how it flows and what to expect while listening to the performance. With this knowledge, I'll know and be able to anticipate when my roommate will be playing, allowing me to appreciate his performance specifically even more. 
- Ask my roommate for sheet music. I almost definitely don't have the musical capacity to closely read it, but at the very least, it'll help me appreciate the complexity of the piece and the hard work of the orchestra. If I get nothing else, I can empathize with the fact that the orchestra is playing some very difficult music. 

# Seen In Practice
[In the mind of Ray: Saint-Saens Introduction & Rondo Capriccioso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LeZNjNhaEA)

Above is a phenomenal rehearsal of Saint-SaÃ«ns' *Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso Op.28*, performed by the soloist Ray Chen and the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra in preparation for their concert together. What's cool is that the video is subtitled with Ray's thoughts as he performs the piece. Seeing his emotional thought process is incredibly enlightening. Even if his thoughts don't necessarily convey what the composer intended, they paint the picture of Ray's interpretation, through which I'm able to listen and empathize with his performance. Seeing this led me to fall in love with the piece.

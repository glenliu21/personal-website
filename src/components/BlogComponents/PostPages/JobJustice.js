        <p>If God is good, why…? </p>

        <p>Why is there so much injustice in the world? Why do people die of hunger every day? </p>

        <p>Though these questions aren’t hard to understand, their implications are vast and profound. Some unbelievers refuse to turn to faith solely because they can’t find a satisfying answer to them. Even many Christians feel uneasy and overwhelmed by the emotional weight of them. And for quite a few dry seasons in my life as well, I struggled to reconcile the existence of a good God and the state of the world today. If God is good, why is there so much suffering in our world? </p>

        <p>This “Problem of Evil” has troubled philosophers since the time of Epicurus and the Ancient Greeks. Yet I believe that the Story of Job, an equally ancient text, provides a crucial perspective into how Christians ought to think about this dilemma. At its core, this Book is a discussion on the virtue of justice, and the conflicting conceptions held by God and the rest of the characters are what create the tension in the story. The common instinct, the mistaken one, is to view God’s justice as how Job’s friends viewed it.</p>

        <p>In Chapter 8 of the Book of Job, Bildad the Shuhite asks: “Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right? If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression” (Job 8:3-4 ESV). Bildad and the rest of his friends held a conception of justice where the good are rewarded and the evil are punished. </p>

        <p>I sympathize with their instinct to assume that Job’s punishment was a result of his wrongdoing, for this view parallels how our society views justice. Our criminal justice system runs on the principle of “retributive justice,” whereby offenders are punished to a degree that’s proportional to their offense. And our markets and institutions are praised for upholding meritocratic ideals, where hard-working members are said to earn what they justly deserve. Because of how ingrained in us this ideal of justice is, this is how we expect God to run His heavenly courts as well. We expect rewards when we do good and punishment for those who wrong us. </p>

        <p>But God operates under no such principle. Curiously, even when He finally confronts Job and his friends, He doesn’t provide his conception of justice, and the reader is left to wonder how exactly God judges the right from the wrong. He doesn’t even tell Job why he was suffering in the first place, a fact the reader knows from the beginning chapter of the Book (where it is explained that Job is being tested by Satan, with the permission of God). Instead, God puts forth a humbling question: “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding” (Job 38:4 ESV). In a sense, God is epistemically checking Job. Like Job, we all weren’t present when God laid the foundation of the earth, and we were not there when He determined how He would judge its affairs. From our lowered vantage point, we have no right to claim what conceptions of justice God should hold. </p>

        <p>Let’s step back and ask ourselves what we can discern about God’s justice. The key assumption at play is that God is good. Indeed, the rest of the question isn’t worth considering if we don’t believe that the omnipotent creator of the world Himself isn’t good. In Psalm 34, David entreats his readers to “taste and see that the Lord is good!” (Psalm 34:8 ESV), and it is from this distinctly non-rational and primitive starting place that we must tackle the question of God’s justice. One must remember that, as Christians, we believe in God with all of our mind and all of our heart. Thus, we have the primacy of the statement “God is good,” for it has its validity and importance not only as a logical axiom but also as an emotional and empirical truth that we believers have experienced. </p>

        <p>Yet I wonder if the full gravity of this starting assumption is always appreciated. Though the idea that “God is good” is one of the most basic principles of the faith, it is not often thought about in its strongest sense. I fear that, instead, goodness is something that we have priorly constructed in our minds, perhaps influenced by other moral philosophies or today’s pop culture outlets, and when we sing that “God is good,” we really only mean to worship God insofar as He is obedient and subordinate to our idealization of the good. As a Chinese-American growing up in a Chinese church, I saw this in believers who shaped their worldview by the culture that they were raised in rather than the guidance of the Word. And on a larger scale, we see a similar confusion of priorities in churches and congregations that swear their allegiance firstly to political parties and worldly movements, then to the teachings of Christ. </p>

        <p>But, as mentioned above, this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means for God to be good. In reality, to say that “God is good” is to say that the two are one and the same. It’s not that God does good, or exemplifies good, but that He quite literally is good. This is an important distinction to make because we then derive our conception of goodness from God, not the other way around. </p>

        <p>Now, if God is good, then He is also just. He alone defines the measurements and weights of justice, and He alone is the Almighty judge of all deeds. Faith calls us to anchor ourselves to this a priori principle: God is good, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, believing in this principle requires us to be humble — in a sense, we don’t and can never fully know what true goodness and justice is like. For if God is good, then to fully know what goodness is is to fully know what God is, an impossible task to complete while we are on earth. Perhaps this is why God didn’t explain his conception of justice to Job and his friends: humans are simply not equipped to fully grasp the true nature of God.</p>

        <p>Yet just as how sanctification, the process of becoming more like Jesus, can never be completed during our time on Earth, so the journey of learning more about God is both unfulfillable — and of the utmost importance. What, then, is our calling? Should we feel dejected knowing that we cannot fully know the nature of goodness and justice? No. On the contrary, we now have all the more motivation to dedicate ourselves to learning more about God.  Whether it be spending more time in His Word or in communion with Him, we seek to draw closer to Him, with the understanding that as we do, He will illuminate to believers the true nature of goodness and justice. In Psalm 119, the psalmist praises God by saying: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Psalm 119:105 ESV). If our goal is to know God’s goodness and live it out, then the first essential step is spending time in His Word. </p>

        <p>And most of all, we are called to live in faith. This faith that we must have is a daily faith, in that even when we suffer great pain from no fault of our own, we still cling onto the truth that God is foremostly good and just. In Psalm 37, David reflects on this theme, reaching the conclusion that “Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked” (Psalm 37:16). No conception of justice could ever validate this belief except for the justice of God that we see discussed in the Book of Job. And yet it is this very same justice that is fully exemplified in Jesus Christ, God’s one and only son. Born into the humblest of settings, he suffered abuse after abuse and ultimately died the humblest of deaths in order that he may be rightfully worshiped as the King of Kings. He bore his cross by taking on this conception of justice, so that all future believers may see that to suffer wrongly as a righteous person is not a reason to denounce God but rather is a calling to hold even faster to Him. </p>
